# Watch GitHub Actions

Monitor GitHub Actions workflow runs using the `gh` CLI.

## Prerequisites

- The `gh` CLI must be authenticated (`gh auth status`)
- You must be in a git repository with a GitHub remote

## Quick Status Check

List recent workflow runs for the current branch:

```bash
gh run list --branch "$(git branch --show-current)"
```

List all recent runs:

```bash
gh run list
```

## Watch a Run in Real Time

Watch a workflow run until it completes:

```bash
gh run watch
```

Watch a specific run:

```bash
gh run watch <run-id>
```

This will continuously update the status until the run finishes (success, failure, or cancelled).

## View Run Details

View a specific run with job details:

```bash
gh run view <run-id>
```

View with full log output:

```bash
gh run view <run-id> --log
```

View a failed job's log:

```bash
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```

## Check Runs for a Specific Branch

Current branch:

```bash
gh run list --branch "$(git branch --show-current)"
```

Specific branch:

```bash
gh run list --branch main
gh run list --branch feature-branch
```

## Check Runs for a PR

List workflow runs associated with a PR:

```bash
# Get the head branch of the PR, then list runs
BRANCH=$(gh pr view <pr-number> --json headRefName --jq '.headRefName')
gh run list --branch "$BRANCH"
```

Or view the checks directly on the PR:

```bash
gh pr checks <pr-number>
```

## List Recent Runs

List runs for the current project:

```bash
gh run list
```

Filter by status:

```bash
gh run list --status failure
gh run list --status success
gh run list --status in_progress
```

Filter by workflow:

```bash
gh run list --workflow "CI"
```

JSON output for scripting:

```bash
gh run list --json databaseId,status,headBranch,url --jq '.[] | {id: .databaseId, status: .status, branch: .headBranch, url: .url}'
```

## View Job Logs

For CI image pin changes, check both `CI image smoke` jobs in `Branch Checks`.
They validate the multiarchitecture index and exercise the baked tools on native
amd64/arm64 runners. A registry denial or missing platform fails these jobs;
do not replace a digest with `latest` to work around it. Smoke checks do not
replace packaging, SDK, kernel, or E2E validation. Follow `CI.md` under
"CI container image pins" for the update and rollback procedure, including the
separate image retained by Docker E2E.

For `Trivy Changes`, inspect the `Resolve PR baseline` step for the base and head
SHAs. PR runs compare the tested merge commit with its
first parent; change detection and scans must use the same pair. On reruns, do
not substitute the current `main` tip or the event's older PR base SHA. Merge
groups and manual runs use their explicit baseline. Findings are reported by
`Reject new high or critical findings`; distinguish those from scanner failures.

View logs for a specific run:

```bash
gh run view <run-id> --log
```

View only failed job logs:

```bash
gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
```

## Wait for Run Completion (Scripting)

Watch and wait for a run to complete:

```bash
RUN_ID=$(gh run list --branch "$(git branch --show-current)" --limit 1 --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId')
gh run watch "$RUN_ID" --exit-status
echo "Run finished with exit code: $?"
```

## Open Run in Browser

Open the latest run in your default browser:

```bash
gh run view --web
```

Open a specific run:

```bash
gh run view <run-id> --web
```

## Rerun Failed Jobs

Rerun all failed jobs in a run:

```bash
gh run rerun <run-id> --failed
```

Rerun an entire run:

```bash
gh run rerun <run-id>
```

## Example Workflow

1. Push your changes and create/update a PR
2. Watch the workflow run:
   ```bash
   gh run watch
   ```
3. If a job fails, view the failed logs:
   ```bash
   gh run view <run-id> --log-failed
   ```
4. Rerun the failed jobs if needed:
   ```bash
   gh run rerun <run-id> --failed
   ```
