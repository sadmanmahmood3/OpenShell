# Agent Instructions

This file is the primary instruction surface for agents contributing to OpenShell. It is injected into your context on every interaction — keep that in mind when proposing changes to it.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for build instructions, task reference, project structure, and the full agent skills table.

## Project Identity

OpenShell is built agent-first. We design systems and use agents to implement them — this is not vibe coding. The product provides safe, sandboxed runtimes for autonomous AI agents, and the project itself is built using the same agent-driven workflows it enables.

## Skills

OpenShell has two skill collections:

- `skills/` contains public, installable skills for using and operating OpenShell. These skills must work outside a source checkout and use installed CLI help plus published documentation as their sources of truth.
- `.agents/skills/` contains internal contributor and maintainer workflows for developing OpenShell. Your repository-aware harness can discover and load them natively.

Do not rely on this file for a full inventory. The detailed public and contributor skill tables are in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) (for humans).

## Public API Conventions

Follow [proto/README.md](proto/README.md) for public protobuf API design. It is
the canonical source for entity-reference naming, workspace selectors, field
design, and schema evolution.

## Sandbox Logging (OCSF)

When adding or modifying log emissions in `openshell-sandbox`, determine whether the event should use OCSF structured logging or plain `tracing`.

### When to use OCSF

Use an OCSF builder + `ocsf_emit!()` for events that represent **observable sandbox behavior** visible to operators, security teams, or agents monitoring the sandbox:

- Network decisions (allow, deny, bypass detection)
- HTTP/L7 enforcement decisions
- SSH authentication (accepted, denied, nonce replay)
- Process lifecycle (start, exit, timeout, signal failure)
- Security findings (unsafe policy, unavailable controls, replay attacks)
- Configuration changes (policy load/reload, TLS setup, provider attachments, settings)
- Application lifecycle (supervisor start, SSH server ready)

### When to use plain tracing

Use `info!()`, `debug!()`, `warn!()` for **internal operational plumbing** that doesn't represent a security decision or observable state change:

- gRPC connection attempts and retries
- "About to do X" events where the result is logged separately
- Internal SSH channel state (unknown channel, PTY resize)
- Zombie process reaping, denial flush telemetry
- DEBUG/TRACE level diagnostics

### Choosing the OCSF event class

| Event type | Builder | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| TCP connections, proxy tunnels, bypass | `NetworkActivityBuilder` | L4 network decisions, proxy operational events |
| HTTP requests, L7 enforcement | `HttpActivityBuilder` | Per-request method/path decisions |
| SSH sessions | `SshActivityBuilder` | Authentication, channel operations |
| Process start/stop | `ProcessActivityBuilder` | Entrypoint lifecycle, signal failures |
| Security alerts | `DetectionFindingBuilder` | Nonce replay, bypass detection, unsafe policy. Dual-emit with the domain event. |
| Policy/config changes | `ConfigStateChangeBuilder` | Policy load, Landlock apply, TLS setup, provider attachments, settings |
| Supervisor lifecycle | `AppLifecycleBuilder` | Sandbox start, SSH server ready/failed |

### Severity guidelines

| Severity | When |
|---|---|
| `Informational` | Allowed connections, successful operations, config loaded |
| `Low` | DNS failures, non-fatal operational warnings, LOG rule failures |
| `Medium` | Denied connections, policy violations, deprecated config |
| `High` | Security findings (nonce replay, Landlock unavailable) |
| `Critical` | Process timeout kills |

### Example: adding a new network event

```rust
use openshell_ocsf::{
    ocsf_emit, NetworkActivityBuilder, ActivityId, ActionId,
    DispositionId, Endpoint, Process, SeverityId, StatusId,
};

let event = NetworkActivityBuilder::new(crate::ocsf_ctx())
    .activity(ActivityId::Open)
    .action(ActionId::Denied)
    .disposition(DispositionId::Blocked)
    .severity(SeverityId::Medium)
    .status(StatusId::Failure)
    .dst_endpoint(Endpoint::from_domain(&host, port))
    .actor_process(Process::new(&binary, pid))
    .firewall_rule(&policy_name, &engine_type)
    .message(format!("CONNECT denied {host}:{port}"))
    .build();
ocsf_emit!(event);
```

### Key points

- `crate::ocsf_ctx()` returns the process-wide `EventContext`. It is always available (falls back to defaults in tests).
- `ocsf_emit!()` is non-blocking and cannot panic. It stores the event in a thread-local and emits via `tracing::info!()`.
- The shorthand layer and JSONL layer extract the event from the thread-local. The shorthand format is derived automatically from the builder fields.
- For security findings, **dual-emit**: one domain event (e.g., `SshActivityBuilder`) AND one `DetectionFindingBuilder` for the same incident.
- Never log secrets, credentials, or query parameters in OCSF messages. The OCSF JSONL file may be shipped to external systems.
- The `message` field should be a concise, grep-friendly summary. Details go in builder fields (dst_endpoint, firewall_rule, etc.).

## Sandbox Infra Changes

- If you change sandbox infrastructure, ensure the relevant sandbox e2e path succeeds.

## Network Sockets

- On latency-sensitive TCP streams, disable Nagle's algorithm so small
  request/response frames don't stall on delayed ACKs. Use
  `openshell_core::net::set_tcp_nodelay_best_effort` on an accepted or
  already-connected stream, or `openshell_core::net::connect_tcp_nodelay_best_effort`
  when dialing.
- This applies to loopback/localhost TCP too — the delayed-ACK stall is a timer
  behavior, not wire latency.
- You should skip it for unix domain sockets (no Nagle). It's not critical for
  test-only connections, though using it on any non-UDS TCP stream — tests
  included — is fine and preferred.

## Commits

- Always use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) format for commit messages
- Format: `<type>(<scope>): <description>` (scope is optional)
- Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `refactor`, `test`, `ci`, `perf`
- Sign off on each commit for DCO compliance. Use the `--signoff` option to `git commit` to add the `Signed-off-by` footer to ensure the user's configured email address is used.
- Never mention Claude or any AI agent in commits (no author attribution, no Co-Authored-By, no references in commit messages)

## Go SDK (`sdk/go/`)

- The Go SDK lives in `sdk/go/` with module path `github.com/NVIDIA/OpenShell/sdk/go`.
- Run `mise run go:ci` for the full SDK CI pipeline (lint, build, test, proto-check, docs-check).
- Proto bindings are generated with `mise run go:proto:gen` from the `.proto` files in `proto/`.
- Domain types in `sdk/go/openshell/v1/types/` must not import proto packages.
- Converters in `sdk/go/openshell/v1/internal/converter/` deep-copy slices and maps at boundaries.
- Tests use bufconn for in-process gRPC and testify for assertions.

## TypeScript SDK (`sdk/typescript/`)

- Run `mise run sdk:ts:ci` for codegen, proto lint, Biome lint, type checking, unit tests, coverage, and build validation.
- Proto bindings are generated with `mise run sdk:ts:proto` from the files selected in `sdk/typescript/buf.gen.yaml`.
- Generated files under `sdk/typescript/src/gen/` are build outputs and must not be committed.
- Keep the curated API free of generated wire types; expose full generated messages and RPCs through `@nvidia/openshell-sdk/raw`.
- The release workflow publishes the package to GitHub Packages. Branch checks exercise the publish path with `npm publish --dry-run`.

## Python

- Always use `uv` for Python commands (e.g., `uv pip install`, `uv run`, `uv venv`)

## Docker

- Always prefer `mise` commands over direct docker builds (e.g., `mise run docker:build` instead of `docker build`)

## Cluster Infrastructure Changes

- If you change gateway deployment infrastructure (e.g., Helm values/templates, gateway image packaging, or deploy logic in `openshell-cli`), update the `debug-openshell-cluster` skill in `skills/debug-openshell-cluster/SKILL.md` to reflect those changes.

## Skill Maintenance

When behavior, commands, or development workflows change, review the related agent skills in the same branch. Use the `sync-agent-infra` skill for the maintenance map and consistency checks.

## Documentation

- Put crate-specific implementation details in the relevant crate `README.md` and design proposals in `rfc/`.
- When changes affect user-facing behavior, make the smallest necessary changes to the relevant published docs pages under `docs/` and navigation in `docs/index.yml`. Explain exactly what users need to know; avoid repeating information across pages or exhaustively describing internals that do not affect users.
- When changing gateway TOML fields, driver-specific config options, config defaults, or Helm rendering of `gateway.toml`, update `docs/how-it-works/gateways/configuration.mdx` in the same branch.
- `fern/` contains the Fern site config, components, preview workflow inputs, publish settings, and publishing documentation in `fern/README.md`.
- Follow the docs style guide in [docs/CONTRIBUTING.mdx](docs/CONTRIBUTING.mdx): active voice, minimal formatting, no filler introductions, `shell` fences for copyable commands, and no duplicate body H1.
- Fern PR previews run through `.github/workflows/branch-docs.yml`. Release Dev publishes `dev`, and Release Tag publishes an immutable stable version plus `latest`. Both production paths call `.github/workflows/sync-docs.yml` once.
- Use the `update-docs-from-commits` skill to scan recent commits and draft doc updates.

## Security

- Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials. If a file looks like it contains secrets (`.env`, `credentials.json`, etc.), do not stage it.
- Do not run destructive operations (force push, hard reset, database drops) without explicit human confirmation.
- Scope changes to the issue at hand. Do not make unrelated changes in the same branch.
