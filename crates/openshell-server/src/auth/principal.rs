//! Authenticated caller principals.
//!
//! A `Principal` is the result of running the [`super::authenticator::Authenticator`]
//! chain on an inbound request. It generalizes over the kinds of callers the
//! gateway recognizes — human users (OIDC), sandbox supervisors (gateway-minted
//! JWT), and anonymous callers (truly unauthenticated methods
//! like health probes).
//!
//! Handlers read the principal from the gRPC `Request` extensions and gate
//! access accordingly. Sandbox-class handlers MUST compare
//! `Principal::Sandbox.sandbox_id` against the request body's `sandbox_id`
//! to prevent cross-sandbox access (see issue #1354).
